# Deep Architecture 

Deep architecture is a deep learning series  where i am covering  all necessary algorithms of neural network. 

Welcome to my **Deep Learning** repo â€”  experimenting, and learning neural nets from scratch and with popular frameworks.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

* **Fundamental Concepts:** Implementations of perceptrons, MLPs, CNNs, RNNs
* **Projects:** Hands-on models on datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, and custom data
* **Experiments:** Trying out architectures, optimizers, and tricks to boost performance
* **Notes & Tutorials:** Bite-sized explanations to solidify understanding
* **Utils & Helpers:** Reusable code for data loading, preprocessing, and visualization
